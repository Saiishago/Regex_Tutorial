### About Challenge

In this challenge we were tasked with first reading up on regular expressions (Regex) then we had to complete one on our own, explain a regex we had found or one that had been provided. A regex (regular expression) is a sequence of characters (both letters and numbers) that forms a search pattern.
In this tutorial we will be discussing how to Match an Alphanumeric Format, how it works and why it works the way it does.
**Regex (regular expression) featured in the tutorial: (\W|^)po[#\-]{0,1}\s{0,1}\d{2}[\s-]{0,1}\d{4}(\W|$)**
The purpose of this tutorial is to give a user/viewer a detailed but not too lengthy explanation of how to Match an Alphanumeric Format.
